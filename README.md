Heart Failure death prediction
=================

A data set about multiple variable to predict death in heart failure 
patients. 

source of [data](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data)
based on  [publication](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5)

I use this data to try raising question and think how the relation of 
multiple variables can be made and I do Exploratory data analysis and plotting 
using tidyverse package.

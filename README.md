Heart Failure death prediction
=================

Heart failure develops when the heart fails to pump blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of body.
Decompensated heart failure lead to multiple admissions, which a burden on health system and to the patients socioeconomic status. Advanced heart failure indicators as high creatinine and presence of diabetes and arrhythmias which is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death.

A retrospective study that evaluated data from the 2010 Nebraska Hospital Discharge files for 4319 hospitalizations of 3521 heart failure patients admitted to 79 in-state hospitals reported that risk factors for in-hospital mortality in these patients were increasing age, the presence of comorbidities, and length of hospital day.

Presence of a tool that can help doctor for predicting a prognosis of heart failure patients based on data can be collected on admission (e.g. age, presence of comorbidities , basic laboratory investigations) can be helpful in medical practice.

A data set about multiple variable which can be use to predict death in heart failure patients.

based on  [publication](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5)

I use this data to try raising question and think how the relation of multiple variables can be made and I do Exploratory data analysis and plotting using tidyverse package.
